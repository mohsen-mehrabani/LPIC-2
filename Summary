Monitoring Data using collectd
for centos
1.yum install epel-release
2.yum install collectd
3. yum install collectd.web

for ubuntu
1.sudo apt-get install collectd
2. configuration file: /etc/collectd.conf and enable what you whant to monitor
3. restart the collectd services. systemctl collectd restart
4. install apache 2 for using collection.cgi in /usr/share/doc/collectd/example
5. sudo a2enmod cgi --> enable  service --> sudo syctemctle restart apache2
6. sudo cp /usr/share/doc/collectd/collection.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin
7. sudo apt-get install librrds-perl libconfig-general-perl libhtml-parser-perl  libregexp-common-perl
8. http://localhost/cgi-bin/collection.cgi
9. I was using virtualbox and got 500 internal error so I checked /var/log/apache2/error.log. The reason for getting 500 
   internal erro was the CGI not found, therefore sudo apt-get install libcgi-session-perl was very usefull


Linux Kernel 201
Objective 201.1: Weight = 2
Kernel 2.6.
Initially, a kernel version number consisted of three parts: major release number, minor release number and the patch level,
all separated by periods.Even-numbered minor releases, e.g. 2.2, 2.4, were considered stable releases and odd-numbered 
releases, e.g. 2.1, 2.3, 2.5 were considered to be development releases.

In 2004, after the release of 2.6.0, the versioning system was changed, and it was decided that a time-based release cycle 
would be adopted. For the next seven years the kernel remained at 2.6 and the third number was increased with each new 
release (which happend every two or three months). A fourth number was added to account for bug and security fixes. An
example of this scheme is kernel 2.6.32.71. The even-odd numbering system was no longer used.

On 29 May 2011, Linus Torvalds announced the release of kernel version 3.0.0 in honour of the 20th anniversary of Linux
In April 2015 kernel version 4.0.0 was released.


Manipulating Kernel Modules

uname -r
modules location /lib/modules
lsmod for listting the modules, rmmod for removing modules and the insmod for inserting modules
insmod does not support appendencies
modules.dep contains the all dependencies
depmod -d make dependencies
modprobe and modeprobe -r
modinfo lists the modules information

Kernel Automation and Configuration
/proc/sys/kernel <----> sysctl.conf
/etc/sysctl.conf    /etc/sysctl.d/* security hardening pakages
/sbin/sysctl configuration on boot
sysctl -a all configuration
sysctl -w(write) the name of configuration 

udev {lsusb, lspci, lsdev, dmesg} udevadm monitor
/etc/modprobe.d/ --> blacklist.conf 

10 - Custom Kernel Compile  The Tools

Download the kernel from http://www.kernel.org and extract to /usr/src
make symbol link to linux with ls -s linux.*/ linux
yum groups install "Development Tools" for centos
yum install ncursors-devel qt-devel

sudo apt-get install build-essential
